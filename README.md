## Requirements

- macOS (currently macOS-only)
- Internet connection for remote AI services (optional)
- API keys for remote services (optional)

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Install the application
3. Launch and grant necessary permissions
4. Configure your AI preferences:
   - Use existing environment variables if set
   - Configure through UI:
     - Select local or remote models
     - Add API keys if needed
     - Customize model parameters
5. Start using voice commands with the default shortcuts!

## Environment Variables

The app automatically detects and uses common environment variables:
```bash
# Remote API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Model Configuration
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4  # Example model choice
MODEL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080  # For custom API endpoints
```

## Configuration

The app allows you to configure:
- AI Model Settings:
  - Model provider (local or remote)
  - API endpoints and keys
  - Model parameters (temperature, context length, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Window preferences for AI chat
- Transcription settings

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using Bun
bun install
```

3. Run the development version:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
# or
bun run tauri dev
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript for the user interface
- **Backend**: Rust-based Tauri for system integration
- **Key Plugins**:
  - `@tauri-apps/plugin-global-shortcut`: Keyboard shortcut management
  - `tauri-plugin-macos-permissions-api`: System permissions
  - `@tauri-apps/plugin-window`: Multi-window management
